FusionPBX vs CoolPBX
====================

CoolPBX has a very different vision of what a PBX should be. CoolPBX will continue to sync against FusionPBX and it will continue to send pull-requests that benefit both projects. At some point, CoolPBX will de-branch as it will continue its own path.

What is the difference?
-----------------

Currently:
- MySQL/MariaDB support (yes!, we do not drop the support to these databases),
- Reseller ready out of the box (aka parent-child domain capability)

What will come:
- LCR and Billing included (once the [campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/jcjcmk-make-billing-4-fusionpbx-opensource) to convert it has been done)
- Enhance CDR Integration (you will be able to create your own plugins that will execute custom actions when the CDR event happens)
- Revamped caching engine
- SMS integration
- REST API
- Revamped XML Handler
- Cluster-ready out of the box
